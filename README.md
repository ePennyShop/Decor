Tip for Christmas Decor

Snow – Everyone knows Christmas is commonly in winter, which also called “White Christmas”.  A common tradition in any home during the holiday season is a Christmas decoration with three major colors White, Red, Green…. Decoration also is a tricky fun job.
As making snow, most of family use as a base, which can be covered the entire Christmas tree stand, tables, boxes even counters and fireplace etc. with a Fluff White decoration blanket. A good trick is to add a strand of clear lights, randomly positioned around the table. And then cover the surface again with a layer of Polyester Fluff White. This creates an illusion of bright and sparkling snow on the ground or any of your base decoration scene.
